# HELLO, WORLD!
Developing **games** and **websites** that is fully-tailored to *user needs* and delivers *memorable experiences*, 
using my favorite formula, **fun** and a handful of **love**! I always seek challenges that will allow me to learn 
and grow to be a adaptable and versatile developer. With this, along with my hunger for knowledge, I constantly do 
study new technologies such as AWS and Docker in my personal time.

## LIFE
Currently a college student, but actively looking for opportunities to grow my expertise and discover people 
who I can collaborate with.

## GOAL
To learn Artificial Intelligence, Game Development, Cloud Computing, Web Development, and other various new technologies, 
in order to challenge myself to learn and grow.
